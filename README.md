This course covers digital image fundamentals, image filtering, image restoration & reconstruction, and other topics. 

The homework assignments involve image theory and code implementation such as image scaling, morphological processing, and denoising.

The final presentation involves a paper study where we chose [this paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_Representative_Color_Transform_for_Image_Enhancement_ICCV_2021_paper.html) 
proposed an image enhancement method called **Representative Color Transform(RCT)** via encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanism. \
Subsequently, we implemented RCT by using [this code](https://github.com/ThanosM97/Representative-Color-Transform) to validate its correctness and apply it to a real picture that we took in a dark environment.\
For more details on how we organized and implemented the final presentation, please refer to [final](https://github.com/YaoDeTsai/Image-Processing/tree/main/Final).
