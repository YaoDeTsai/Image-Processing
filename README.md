This course covers digital image fundamentals, image filtering, image restoration & reconstruction, and other topics. \
The homework assignments involve image theory and code implementation such as image scaling, morphological processing, and denoising.\
The final presentation involves a paper study where we chose [this paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_Representative_Color_Transform_for_Image_Enhancement_ICCV_2021_paper.html) 
proposed an image enhancement method called **Representative Color Transform(RCT)** via encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanism. 
Then we implemented RCT by using [this code](https://github.com/ThanosM97/Representative-Color-Transform) to validate its correctness and applied it to a real picture taken in a dark environment.
